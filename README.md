# INTRODUCTION
----

Centralised Monitoring And Control System(CMCS) is the combination of a remote host handler(MotherNode) and a script(client) purely written in python that can bring the client system under the administrative authority of the MMotherNode.The server script is named server.py..
The server provides the functionality of simultaneously handling and listening for multiple incoming socket connections.
The code base consists of four client side codes namely:

ciscontrols.py **This is for Checking and Implementing few CIS Compliance And Benchmarks.**

client.py **The Client-Side code to initiate a reverse TCP connection**

dependencyclient.sh **A bash script to check all the required dependencies(binaries) are installed or not**

splunkenable.py **To start splunk-forwarder on remote clients to monitor their logs in Splunk-UI**


>This project has been made public so anyone can contribute to this project.


# OS REQUIREMENTS
----
The Program has been made and tested to work on Centos7 and DEBIAN 9




# FEATURES
----
- The Server can interact with one client while it is still listening for incoming connection from other clients.
- New connections are appended to a table that can be used later.
- The client script(agent) provides feature of persistence on platforms like centos or debian(adding a cronjob in crontab.)
- The script copies itself into the admin folder in the home directory and autoruns on reboot so that it works even if the original file is deleted by user.
- It **works over wan also** provided there is an ip connectivity between the MotherNode and the client.
- CIS Benchmarks that are applicable for the remote host can be listed and applied remotely.
- Splunk Forwarder can be configured on the remote host.
- Os,Memory and cpu statistics of the remote host can be monitored.
- List of Users (privileged and non-privileged ) present on the remote system can be viewed.
- Files can be transferred to and fro between server and client.
- Some commands that can be run on the clients are :-



|      COMMAND      | DESCRIPTION                                            |
|:-----------------:|--------------------------------------------------------|
|        exit       | back to mothership(stay connected to the bot)          |
|        help       | see this table                                         |
|     screenshot    | take a screenshot of bot and save to cwd of mothership |
|  shell*<command>  | execute a shell command on bot                         |
|  grab*<file_name> | transfer a file from cwd of bot to cwd of mothership   |
| upload*<filename> | transfer a file from cwd of mothership to cwd of bot   |

|     status        | get os memory and cpu statistics of remote client      |
|     cischeck      | get current cis complaint status of remote client      |
|     cisenable     | make remote system cis complaint                       |
|     message       | send message to the remote host                        |

- The status command is used to view the system-information of the connected clients:

- The **cischeck** command checks for the current status of CIS Compliance and Benchmarks of the client:

- The **cisenable** command enables all the disabled CIS Compliance and Benchmarks:

- The **splunkenable** command installs and configures splunk to forward system logs to our splunk server:

- Starting Splunk Server(Listening):

>before administring the splunkenable command splunkserver and gui must be set up and listening on server side

- Running the **splunkenable** command and waiting for the splunk forwarder to get configured in the remote host:

- Completion of splunk forwarder configuration in the remote host(client) and connection to server established(debian):

- A user with knowledge of python can write his own functionalities that can be easily incorporated into the existing clients.

- User can quit the script safely using the exit command and the clients will go to sleep for 10 sec.After which they will go back to the task of trying to connect back to the MotherNode.So when the person starts the mothernode again his clients will connect back again:
